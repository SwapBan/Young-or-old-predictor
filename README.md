# Young-or-old-predictor
This model can predict whether the given image as input is old or young. The model is trained using keras ImageDataGenerator  , the model contains Convolution Layers (which contains Feature Detector which detects edges or convex shapes in the image) and MaxPooling Layers(which finds maximal value in neighbour pixels , reducing the image size by half).
